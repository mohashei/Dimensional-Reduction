## The Laplacian Eigenmaps/TSNE visualization page.

Here we give an example of the dimensional reduction techniques using jupyter notebooks. We have 3 different methods we try in this notebook:
1. PCA
2. Laplacian Eigenmaps
3. TSNE (and Barnes-Hut TSNE as well)
With these three we hope to visualize distributions of avalanches of stars. In particular, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P(s | O_t )=\text { Probability of a sensor reading value when sleep onset is observed at a time bin } t " />
