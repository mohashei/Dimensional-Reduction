## The dimensional reduction and visualization project.

Here we give an example of the dimensional reduction techniques using jupyter notebooks. We have 3 different methods we try in this notebook:
1. PCA
2. Laplacian Eigenmaps
3. TSNE (and Barnes-Hut TSNE as well)

With these three we hope to visualize distributions of avalanches of stars. In particular, we want to visualize the space of such distributions. Since this space is approximately 500-dimensional, we use the three different dimensional reduction techniques to visualize our results.
